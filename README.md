# Apex Verify AI

Apex Verify AI is the trust layer for modern creators. We deliver precise authenticity checks for visual media today and are scaling toward audio, video, and generative artwork. Our focus is simple: confirm what’s real, flag what’s synthetic, and provide evidence that decision-makers can rely on.

## What We Deliver

- Deterministic verdicts backed by confidence scoring
- Visual forensics that highlight suspicious regions
- A persistent verification memory that recognizes assets instantly
- Production-grade operations with strict validation and predictable latency

## How It Works

- A Next.js application handles uploads, orchestrates analysis, and surfaces results in real time.
- A Python pipeline executes model inference, proprietary manipulation heuristics, and heatmap generation on dedicated infrastructure.
- Processed outcomes are stored for auditability so teams can trace every verdict over time.

## Where We’re Going

- Extend authenticity checks beyond still imagery to audio, long-form video, and mixed media.
- Build longitudinal analytics that track drift, detect spoofing attempts, and surface emerging manipulation tactics.
- Offer controlled integrations for partners that need to automate verification at scale.
